# Toolbox Delpher demo site
This repository contains several features belonging to the website http://delpher_demo.kbresearch.nl/

The following items are present:
* Code of the website
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Datasets


## Code of the website
The full code of the website has been made available on this Githubpage. It can be found in the folder 'website'.
This code can be used to replicate the website. This also enables you to make  a similar website with other subjects, 
or you can improve our website! Please don't hesitate to share your projects with us, we would be delighted to hear about them!

Due to copyright laws, the original database of the website could not be made available. 
Therefore, we have provided a database with a limited amount of newspaper articles in the near future. 

## Jupyter Notebooks
If you just want to play with the  data and the visualisations that are provided on the website, you can use the Jupyter Notebooks (https://jupyter.org/) and the test datasets. The programming language used in the notebooks is Python. 

If Github has trouble showing the notebooks (this happens occasionally), you can paste the url in the Notebook viewer from Jupyter.org (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org).

## Datasets
There are three different datasets provided. Which dataset to use, depends on the Notebook you want to try. At the start of each Notebook, the datasets that you need are stated. 

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us via mirjam.cuper@kb.nl!
